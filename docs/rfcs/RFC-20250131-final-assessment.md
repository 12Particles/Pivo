# RFC-20250131 Implementation Final Assessment

## Summary

Successfully completed the refactoring of the task-attempt-execution architecture according to RFC-20250131-task-attempt-execution-architecture.md. All compatibility code has been removed and the system now uses the target architecture.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Task Commands Refactoring** (`task_commands.rs`)
   - Removed `StartExecution` command
   - Updated `SendMessage` to use saved `claude_session_id` for session resume
   - Simplified command structure to only `SendMessage` and `StopExecution`

2. **Event System Updates**
   - Changed event names from dash-separated to colon-separated format:
     - `task-attempt-created` → `task:attempt-created`
     - `task-status-updated` → `task:status-changed`
   - Removed legacy events:
     - `coding-agent-output` (debug output)
     - `coding-agent-process-completed`

3. **Service Layer Updates** (`service.rs`)
   - Updated all event emissions to new format
   - Removed references to non-existent methods

### Frontend Changes

1. **Task Conversation Component**
   - Added `session:received` listener to save Claude session ID
   - Updated event listeners to new format

2. **State Management Hooks**
   - `useTaskConversationState`: Updated to listen to new events
   - `useTaskCommand`: Simplified to match new command structure
   - Removed unused parameters

3. **API Layer Cleanup**
   - Removed deprecated `execute` method from TaskApi
   - Removed unused compatibility aliases
   - Cleaned up unused exports

4. **Event Types**
   - Removed legacy event definitions
   - Updated imports to remove unused types

### Files Removed

1. `/src/features/projects/hooks/useProjectManagement.ts` - Temporary compatibility stub
2. `/src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskOperations.ts` - Temporary compatibility stub
3. `/src/hooks/domain/useVcs.ts` - Replaced with single comment

## Key Achievement

The most important fix was ensuring that the `claude_session_id` stored in the database is actually used for session resume. Previously, the system was passing `None` to the Claude agent, which meant sessions couldn't be resumed. Now the system correctly:

1. Captures the session ID when Claude starts
2. Stores it in the database
3. Uses it for subsequent messages to resume the session

## Verification

All compatibility code marked with TODOs, @deprecated annotations, or temporary comments has been removed. The system now fully implements the three-layer architecture (Task → Attempt → Execution) as designed in the RFC.
